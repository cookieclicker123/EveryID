# EveryID: a repository for the recognition of people, objects, scenes and events.

The goal is to push the best transformers in the world to perform beyond all current benchmarks for recognition tasks.

One will find their is much more to such a task than simply training a transformer on a large dataset of images and labels.

How does one manage multiple cameras, different footage days, occlusions of light and object, and higher pixel wise similiarity between instances of different 

people than themself? Of course no matter how good the vectors that represent a person are, you can't match everything when they concept of similiarty 
doesnt have such a clear metric of accuracy. People , places, concepts, these are far noisier than simply object detection.

Intra class problems are far more complex than inter class problems in deep learning and this is a continuation of that pattern, which is why 
person reidentification is a largely unsolved problem as opposed to object , ananomly and shape detection.

In a similiar vein, the human visual cortex has to make rapid assumptions about what they've seen and whether its been seen before.

This isnt simple retrieval, this is complex recognition of a permenant representation of a thing that is permanenlty changing.

paradoxial, yet invariant reprsentation in the human brain allows for such a gift.

Our goal is to give machines the same gift.

## Applications

 - TV Post Production: people who log and sync up time code have the laborious job of fishing through thousands of hours of footage in a manual fahsion.
   We should be able to simply index large amounts of footage in a similair way to textual rag systems, and build knowledge graphs of person, scene, and concept clusters that focus more on what is probabilistically likely given context and trakcing , rather than what achieves the most probability frame to frame.
   This way, large productions become immediately searchable and the need for a human editor to watch hours of footage becomes obsolete.
